# What is this?
This is a collection of scripts taking baby steps* towards building an interactive tool to associate 
topological features - in particular loops/voids - with some reasonable subset of the data 
which is "responsible" (aka, a generator). Here the topological features are represented by birth/death pairs.

\**Yes, I'm aware of how git works, but I prefer to have hard checkpoints for increasingly complex functionality.*

# Requirements
* numpy (I'm on version 1.18.3 but earlier versions are probably fine)
* matplotlib (I'm on version 3.0.3)
* scikit-tda; specifically Cechmate (version 0.0.8) and PHAT (version ???)
